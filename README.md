My app is for fishermen looking to post photos of fish they've got as well as show other fishermen where they caught them. By allowing the users to create the data themselves, it can help give other fishermen an idea of what type of fish are in a certain area and what they can use to catch them. Google Maps helped to pinpoint specific locations using coordinates. You can see where, when and how someone caught a fish by looking at the photo show page. 

Ultimately I wanted to include a location database as well but, with only a week to create this app, I wasn't able to add that feature in. If users are able to input data into specific locations, finding and catching fish could become a much simpler proposition.

While I am happy with the finished product, there is always more that can be implemented. Given more time, I would fix the following issues:

- The Google Maps coordinates input allows users to specify exactly where they were when they caught their fish. While this is a great way of acheiving specificity, it's not at all user friendly. I would like to research this further to see how to make it easier on the user. I looked into finding API keys based on addresses, but seeing how these are fishing holes (sometimes in the middle of nowhere), addresses don't help either. At the very least, I would like to add a modal on the 'Add Photo' screen to explain how users can find coordinates/

- To make this more user friendly, I want to be able to have the user click on the photos on the users index page to get to the photo show page. The same goes for the posts in the user profile. These are not hard fixes but didn't come up until doing my walk thru a day before. Fixing this would make for a much easier user experience

- Additionally I want to make sure that this is easily scalable. Right now, the background doesn't keep up with a large number of photos or users. Once again, relatively easy fix, just need a little more time to make this workable.

- On the photos page, I would also like to add a 'Posted By' option underneath the photo to take you to the user profile. 

Essentially there are a few items that aren't as user friendly as I would like and I would like to be able to create a significant database for the locations. Given ample time, I believe I could have figured this out quickly and made it a much more user friendly and scalable product.
